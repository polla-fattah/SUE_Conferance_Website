	<p class="normal"> <font face="Times New Roman "><b>Erbil</b></font> <br>Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, is over 8,000 years old, and is one of the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in the world. Resting resolutely in the center of the city is the famous Citadel of Erbil, an ancient walled fortress that is now an important archeological treasure. Although the citadel has been under the rule of many powers over the last 8,000 years, its archeological museum now protects a large collection of pre-Islamic artifacts. The modern city of Erbil, despite having endured much upheaval during the last few decades of Iraqi history, has been transformed within the previous decade into a thriving, cosmopolitan center, boasting modern shopping malls, lush parks, high-rise offices, and amusement parks.</P>
